# PortfolioKiri
Scripts and data files for climate informed tree species portfolio optimisation. Portfolio functions are sourced from PortfolioOptimisation.py and SimGrowth.cpp, and CCISS functions are sourced from CCISS_Fns.R. Species portfolio optimisation uses SpeciesPortfolio.Rmd, which can then feed into a climate-based seed transfer portfolio (CBSTPorfolio.R).

Input files are stored in InputsGit, except for files which are too large (namely the BGC model and input climate data).
